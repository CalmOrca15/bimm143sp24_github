## What is in the PDB database?

The main repository of biomolecular structures is PDB < www.rcsb.org >

Let's see what the database contains:

```{r}
pdb = "pdb_stats.csv"
pdbstats = read.csv(pdb, row.names = 1)
head(pdbstats)
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.


```{r}
x <- pdbstats$Total
sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", x)))
```


```{r}
tum <- function(x)
{
 
  x <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
  return(x)
}

```

```{r}
total <- tum(pdbstats$Total)
xray <- tum(pdbstats$X.ray)
em <- tum(pdbstats$EM)
nmr <- tum(pdbstats$NMR)
answer <- (xray + em)/total
answer

```


> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

In UniProt there are 248,805,733 distinct entries which comapred to PDB protein entries 

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?


## Visualizing HIV-1 Protease structure using Mol*

Mol* viewer viewer can be accessed at <https://molstar.org/viewer/>

I want to insert the image taken form Mol*

## Working with bio3d package

```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1HSG")
pdb
head(pdb$atom)
```
```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)[25]
```

##Predicting functional motions of a single structure

We can do a bioifnromatics prediction of functional motions (i.e. flexibility/dynamics)

```{r}
pdb2 <- read.pdb("6s36")
pdb2
```

```{r}
m <-nma(pdb2)
plot(m)
```

```{r}
mktrj(m, file = "adk_m7.pdb")
```
